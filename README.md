# Light.

Submission to **Ludum Dare 46**

This is the source code for the **light.** Probably everything in this project starting from scripts all the way to settings is wrong, but this is ludum dare, nothing is perfect.

Some key features in this game that I'm proud of:

* Bezier curve editor (the orb has to follow a path. This path was created with this editor)
* World generator (I actually felt like I will never finish the level, so writing a generator for it was a 200 IQ move)

I have to mention that every asset was made by me. Programs used:

* Engine: Unity
* Art: Paint.net, Photoshop
* Programming: Visual Studio
* Music: Soundtrap
* SFX: sfxr, Audacity
